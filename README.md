The Web3 RPC location will be picked up from the `truffle.js` file.

0. Clone this repo
0. `npm install`
0. Make sure `testrpc` is running on its default port. Then:
  - `npm run start` - Starts the development server
  - `npm run build` - Generates a build
  - `truffle test` - Run the rest suite (there are no tests at the moment)

If you `npm run start`, the app will be available at <http://localhost:3001>.
